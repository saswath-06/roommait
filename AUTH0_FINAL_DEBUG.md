# üö® FINAL AUTH0 DEBUG - code_verifier Still Failing

## Current Status
‚úÖ Application Type: Native
‚úÖ Grant Types: Authorization Code + Refresh Token
‚úÖ Auth flow working (success)
‚ùå Token exchange failing with code_verifier error

## CRITICAL: Check Token Endpoint Authentication Method

This is likely still set incorrectly. We need to verify this exact setting:

### Steps to Check:
1. In your Auth0 app settings (main settings tab, NOT Advanced Settings)
2. Look for "Token Endpoint Authentication Method"
3. This MUST be set to **"None"**

If you can't find this setting on the main page, it might be in a different location.

## Alternative: Create New Auth0 App

Since the issue persists despite all changes, let's create a fresh Auth0 application to eliminate any hidden configuration issues:

### Steps:
1. Go to Auth0 Dashboard
2. Create new application
3. Name: "roomait-mobile"
4. Type: "Native" (from the start)
5. Configure with these exact settings:
   - Application Type: Native
   - Token Endpoint Authentication Method: None
   - Grant Types: Authorization Code, Refresh Token only
   - OIDC Conformant: Enabled

### Then update your app config:
- Copy the new Client ID
- Update your auth0.ts config file
- Test with fresh application

This approach eliminates any potential hidden settings or cache issues with the current Auth0 app.
